# Echo360 Downloader

A Chrome extension to grab MP4s and audio from Echo360 lectures, and downloads them straight to your device.

I took this class in college that I really liked but didn't go to enough lecture for it,
so after the semester was over I figured I would watch all the lectures on my own time.
I asked my professor if they could enable the 'download' feature for the Echo360 lectures, which a lot of my other classes do.
However, they said they don't feel like it and blah blah. So I said bet, and did a whole lot of sniffing around 
to find out how to do it myself. With my creativity and passion to try new things, especially things that frustrate me, I used the directional support of ChatGPT
to develop a Google Chrome Extension that downloads any Echo360 Lecture, with very minimal user setup. 

Please, if you have questions OR it doesn't work for you or your school - Please create an issue on Github and I will address it ASAP. Thank you! And I hope this helps.. and works lol.
